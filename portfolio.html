                <p>Hi there! So you're interested in my hobbies.
                    Well, some of my hobbies include the following
                </p>
                <img style="float:right; padding: left 100px;" src="music.webp" width="300" height="150">
                <ul>
                    <li><h2>Singing and listening to music</h2></li>
                    <p style="text-align:left">I'm pretty sure that almost everyone in this world loves music. But I love singing as well because it brings my joy and calms my nerves everytime.
                        Also, my favourite band that I listen to most of the time is the group "Pentatonix". If you haven't heard of them, I'd recommend checking them out.
                        I've also been into Japanese music lately, which is completely different from regular pop.  
                    </p>

                    <li><h2>Watching Movies</h2></li>
                    <p>Oooh, who doesn't love a good movie? If you ask me what my favourite genre is, I'll always say horror and mystery.
                        Maybe add a little of bit of thriller to add some spice.
                        A genre that I'm not too fond of is romance. Why? It's too cheesy for me and my taste.
                        But the adrenaline rush I get from spooky scenes and the anticipation from thrillers are on a different level.
                        Mystery films have the ability to keep me thinking about the different possible scenarios that can arise from a particular situation
                        and also keeps me on my toes without fail!

                </a>
                <p>
                    Well I wasn't very sure of what I wanted to include here as there's not much I've done 
                    but I keep learning new things everyday. I'm working hard to be a better and smarter person
                    so that I can look back and see how far come! Wish me luck!
